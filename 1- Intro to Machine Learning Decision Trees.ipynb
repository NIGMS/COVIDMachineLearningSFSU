This is ideal because Decision Trees are the basis for more complex models such as Boosted Trees or Random Forests. Below we have a general introduction video to Machine Learning by Lorena Benitez."

    "# WHAT IS A DECISION TREE?\n",
    "\n",
    " A **Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning model that allows us to make predictions by learning simple decision rules that are inferred using available information in the dataset. \n",
    " \n",
    "- A Decision Tree is called a **\"Supervised\"**  model because we know exactly what we want to figure out. For example, for our Decision Tree, we will specify that we want to figure out the missing values of the column **\"Cases per 100 000 people\"**, and our model will try to find these values by making predictions for them using the the information we do have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast, in an **\"Unsupervised\"**  model, we do not know exactly what we want to predict for. Instead, an Unsupervised model finds hidden relationships between different types of information and can group them based on similaries. For example, Netflix surprising you with a new show you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Decision Tree** can be pictured as a tree-like flowchart, where we start with a particular criteria and based on whether this is True (Y for Yes) or False (N for No), we chose only one of the branches. This process is then repeated at every decision until we reach the bottom of the tree, where we end up with a specific prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "![General-Decision-Tree.png](images/General-Decision-Tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how a Decision Tree can help us predict the missing **cases per 100 000 people** in more detail later on in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information about different ways to clasify machine learning models here: [Machine Learning Models](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-machine-learning/?ref=lbp)\n",
